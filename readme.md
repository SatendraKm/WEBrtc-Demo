# how to start?
just run the script <code> npm run start </code> and then both the frontend and backend server will run simultaneously.

these are the steps that I'm gonna use to create a zoom like app.. 
this project is just for demo purpose so it will be very basic and have a simple and clean ui and a server responsible for managing all the transfer of connection strings.


list of packages used-
1. express
2. socket.io
3. react
4. WEBrtc


important points to consider- 
1. webrtc is a peer to peer connection so we need to handle the connection and disconnection
